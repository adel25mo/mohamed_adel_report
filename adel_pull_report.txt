pull requests are a mechanism for a developer to notify 
   team members that they have completed a feature. Once their
   feature branch is ready, the developer files a pull request 
   via their Bitbucket account. This lets everybody involved know 
   that they need to review the code and merge it into the master branch.

   But, the pull request is more than just a notification—it’s a dedicated 
   forum for discussing the proposed feature. If there are any problems with 
   the changes, teammates can post feedback in the pull request and even tweak 
   the feature by pushing follow-up commits. All of this activity is tracked
   directly inside of the pull request.
